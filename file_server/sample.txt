Hello, world! This is a sample text file for testing the Pied Piper compression algorithm. 
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. 
This text should compress well with Huffman coding because it has repeated characters and patterns.
Let's see how well our compression algorithm performs on this sample data!
This is additional text to make the file larger and test compression efficiency.
The more text we have, the better Huffman compression typically performs.
Repeated words and characters will help demonstrate the compression ratio.
Hello again! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog once more.
