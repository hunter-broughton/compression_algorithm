# Compression Algorithm

This is a Rust implementation of Huffman coding compression algorithm.

## Features
- Huffman tree building
- Optimal code generation  
- Binary data encoding
- Text file compression

## Usage
```bash
cargo run -- --input file.txt --output file.compressed --mode compress
```

The algorithm works by analyzing character frequencies and building an optimal binary tree.
